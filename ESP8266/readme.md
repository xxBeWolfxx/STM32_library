# ESP8266
This is the library to connect and cooperate STM32 and ESP8266 via USRAT. Communication between units is based on commands, which are expandable. In my case, I used only 5 commands from ESP and 3 commands to ESP. In Cpp file I wrote two common methods: connecting and turnOff. Special codes which start with "T" letter are migrated as variables.
