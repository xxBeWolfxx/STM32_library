# SerialMonitor
This is the library to send data via USART. In this library, I used interrupts. Serial can work in two different ways. You can be declared buffer with some characters or interrupt can be called one by one character. After the message, which filled buffer, you can return the information. 

## Warning
All methods are based on strings!
